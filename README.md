# Backlog Media Server Web Interface
This is the repository which contains frontend code for my Backlog personal media server.

This project is developed as part of the Salem State University Capstone Project (ITE 505).

This repository has a companion, ld9/backlog-server,
which contains the server (api) component of this application.
